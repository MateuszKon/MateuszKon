## Hello there!

My name is Mateusz Koniuszewski and I am junior **Python Developer**.

I would like to introduce you to a few projects developed (or currently being developed) by myself:
- APIStockServer - Currently I am working on this project and it represents my programming style and skills (e.g. using **SOLID** principles). Server works with **PostgreSQL** database, implements **RESTful API**. Currently server checks some ETF prices of precious metals and calculates discounts - then informs subscribed users about discount (when threshold is exceeded). In the future users will be able register themselves and set some alerts for pricing etc. or note some transactions done on those stocks. Afterwards some website will be prepared to access this web server.
- L5XeTree - This is my first module created to avoid repeating the same work during automating PLC programming process. Module was created using **OOP** principles. Some simple **unittest**s are implemented for bug checking during implementing new features. Whole development of this project is not availabe here on GitHub as it was imported from TortoiseSVN version control system.
- L5XModifier â€“ My first GUI application created with **PySide6 (Qt)** and **QtDesigner**. App uses L5XeTree module. It was created to make possible using prepared module by coworkers. With PyInstaller it is possible to create standalone version of application.
